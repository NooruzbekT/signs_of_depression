Ive been doing this for so long its so tiring. Constantly helping people feel better but never having someone to help me. Being the emotional support for my friend and then for family has gotten too much. Too much negativity at home and in life itself. I have 1 friend and that's it. I had a spouse but they told me I was too much to handle mentally so they left me. I lost the one thing that was keeping me going. I cant remember the last time I felt genuine happiness, I haven't in so long. I look back and just see pain. I've attempted so many times that I cant even count on both my hands. Im gonna try again and I hope it works this time. I literally can't deal with this pain anymore. Getting constantly put through so much emotional and physical damage has worn me down too much. I just don't have anything to keep me here so why should I stay here. Im in an endless cycle of pain and I don't have or see a future on earth so it really doesn't matter. Nobody truly cares about me because in the end they all leave one way or another.   \n","2  I hate my life. There's no point to it anymore.The option of suicide keeps crossing my mind lately. I hate it so much but I honestly don't see a downside to it at this point. Nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody's life would change at all if i were just suddenly gone. Not one single person would even notice if I were suddenly gone. None of my \"friends\" will even talk to me anymore and I honestly have no clue why. Not like I've done something to piss off any of them. I end up sitting alone in my bedroom alone day after day, trying to get some of my \"friends\" to hang out with me, even just for a little bit. I end up just sitting around, alone and forgotten. It's like some vicious circle. Being alone and forgotten makes me more depressed, yet being depressed makes people ignore you. Until you decide that living a life of depression isn't worth it anymore and you take the most obvious way out. Then, of course, everybody talks about how that person was such a good friend, and how great a person they were, even if they didn't fucking know the lonely bastard. Seen it happen so many times already in my short life.\\n\\nI'm so tired of feeling like i'm fighting for my sanity constantly. I don't really even want to commit suicide. I just want this loneliness, this emptiness, to go away. I so desperately need a shoulder to cry on, but those closest to me have turned their backs on me. I don't even know what the fuck to do anymore. Nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. I feel like I have reason to live anymore.   \n","3                                                                                   Perfect lifeI suppose this is very ridiculous to insinuate- but basically, I've had such a wonderful upbringing that well, I don't really see the point in living on. I've hit the genetic jackpot and experienced almost all there is to experience on this earth. I feel like people are happy because they have a sense of purpose, like they live to earn wealth and use it to experience new things. So as long as they don't fall into poverty or encounter major pitfalls during their pursuit, they're happy. \\n\\nAnd yes, meanwhile I'm just sitting here whining about how my life has been so perfect, that everything has become meaningless to me. Whatever wealth can unlock, I have unlocked. It's like everyone's still running a race, and I'm sitting alone at the finish line. What's the point of living when it's only going to get worse from here on?\\n\\n I used to say that school or work or whatever commitment, made me so busy with no time for me to catch a breather. Then I realized that wasn't true. I gave myself no breathers. Because now is the \"resting\" period and I'm spending it shut in and crying my eyes out. \\n\\nMy SO just left me recently. Or that's what I assume, he just stopped talking to me altogether. Romance was the one thing I didn't have, and I told myself that I'd stick around and live as a moral duty- to make him happy. But I'm a terrible person and he left. \\n\\nThe only logical step from here on is to die, but I'm too much of a coward, I fear the pain of falling too much.    \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 What's a game everyone grew up with?

I felt happy again. Like I could move forward. Like there was a way forward, even if it meant a future without you. But these past few days, I have come crashing back. I don't want someone else. What we had was perfect.\\n\\nAnd I don't know why you had to leave it. \\n\\nI deserved that happiness. I fought for it for so long. And you just took it all away from me so you could feel like a hero. \\nI want to be mad. So mad that I could never want to think of you again. But I can't. Because I know you had the best of intentions. I know you were trying to save someone, damn the consequences. And that's what I love about you. You are never petty or selfish. You're chaotic good. Always acting based on how things should be. Always optimistic. Never tied down by reality.\\n\\nBut you didn't need to do what you did to feel like a hero. To save someone. You were saving me.   \n","9

Ive been doing this for so long its so tiring. Constantly helping people feel better but never having someone to help me. Being the emotional support for my friend and then for family has gotten too much. Too much negativity at home and in life itself. I have 1 friend and that's it. I had a spouse but they told me I was too much to handle mentally so they left me. I lost the one thing that was keeping me going. I cant remember the last time I felt genuine happiness, I haven't in so long. I look back and just see pain. I've attempted so many times that I cant even count on both my hands. Im gonna try again and I hope it works this time. I literally can't deal with this pain anymore. Getting constantly put through so much emotional and physical damage has worn me down too much. I just don't have anything to keep me here so why should I stay here. Im in an endless cycle of pain and I don't have or see a future on earth so it really doesn't matter. Nobody truly cares about me because in the end they all leave one way or another.  \n","2  I hate my life. There's no point to it anymore.The option of suicide keeps crossing my mind lately. I hate it so much but I honestly don't see a downside to it at this point. Nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody's life would change at all if i were just suddenly gone. Not one single person would even notice if I were suddenly gone. None of my \"friends\" will even talk to me anymore and I honestly have no clue why. Not like I've done something to piss off any of them. I end up sitting alone in my bedroom alone day after day, trying to get some of my \"friends\" to hang out with me, even just for a little bit. I end up just sitting around, alone and forgotten. It's like some vicious circle. Being alone and forgotten makes me more depressed, yet being depressed makes people ignore you. Until you decide that living a life of depression isn't worth it anymore and you take the most obvious way out. Then, of course, everybody talks about how that person was such a good friend, and how great a person they were, even if they didn't fucking know the lonely bastard. Seen it happen so many times already in my short life. I'm so tired of feeling like i'm fighting for my sanity constantly. I don't really even want to commit suicide. I just want this loneliness, this emptiness, to go away. I so desperately need a shoulder to cry on, but those closest to me have turned their backs on me. I don't even know what the fuck to do anymore. Nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. I feel like I have reason to live anymore.  \n","3                                                                                                   Perfect lifeI suppose this is very ridiculous to insinuate but basically, I've had such a wonderful upbringing that well, I don't really see the point in living on. I've hit the genetic jackpot and experienced almost all there is to experience on this earth. I feel like people are happy because they have a sense of purpose, like they live to earn wealth and use it to experience new things. So as long as they don't fall into poverty or encounter major pitfalls during their pursuit, they're happy. And yes, meanwhile I'm just sitting here whining about how my life has been so perfect, that everything has become meaningless to me. Whatever wealth can unlock, I have unlocked. It's like everyone's still running a race, and I'm sitting alone at the finish line. What's the point of living when it's only going to get worse from here on? I used to say that school or work or whatever commitment, made me so busy with no time for me to catch a breather. Then I realized that wasn't true. I gave myself no breathers. Because now is the \"resting\" period and I'm spending it shut in and crying my eyes out. My SO just left me recently. Or that's what I assume, he just stopped talking to me altogether. Romance was the one thing I didn't have, and I told myself that I'd stick around and live as a moral duty to make him happy. But I'm a terrible person and he left. The only logical step from here on is to die, but I'm too much of a coward, I fear the pain of falling too much.  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              What's a game everyone grew up with?

And I thought I was doing better. I was put on an M1 hold. But when I got out, I really tried. I quit smoking. Started taking higher dosages of my meds. I even started seeing someone else. I felt happy again. Like I could move forward. Like there was a way forward, even if it meant a future without you. But these past few days, I have come crashing back. I don't want someone else. What we had was perfect. And I don't know why you had to leave it. I deserved that happiness. I fought for it for so long. And you just took it all away from me so you could feel like a hero. I want to be mad. So mad that I could never want to think of you again. But I can't. Because I know you had the best of intentions. I know you were trying to save someone, damn the consequences. And that's what I love about you. You are never petty or selfish. You're chaotic good. Always acting based on how things should be. Always optimistic. Never tied down by reality. But you didn't need to do what you did to feel like a hero. To save someone. You were saving me.  \n","9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Someone dm me I am bored and could use someone to talk to  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-b87221d6-7671-4bc1-8ffa-0951fe4d44ad\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>class</th>\n","      <th>clean text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>265629</td>\n","      <td>My frieng got a new pajama and decided to convince us why it was the best &amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msp9gkoqmy661.png?width=1000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1b001d6ecf9a06307e1db72024f11adda934a4f4</td>\n","      <td>non-suicide</td>\n","      <td>My frieng got a new pajama and decided to convince us why it was the best ampx200B</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>312349</td>\n","      <td>I cant do thisI really don't know what to do anymore.
